    "extended_details": "We would like to streamline and automate a process for drawing pictures of people in a fun and interactive way.  Users take a picture with their friends, the system saves the image and converts it into a drawable format.  Then, either a 3-D printer, drawing machine, or custom rig will draw the image and users can keep the drawn output as a souvenir.",
