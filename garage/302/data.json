    "extended_details": "Many people have trouble getting up in the morning, whether it's because of the suffocating allure of the snooze button or because they simply, yet inexplicably, sleep through their alarm. Well with this neat little thingamabob, we can all kiss our alarm clock hating ways goodbye! This device will rouse you from your slumber by shaking you with increasing violence, making it impossible to go back to sleep! Never again will you raise your fists in the air and curse the world after missing your final! Never again will your violently throw your bleeping phone across the room before your regrettably early 8:30 class! You'll be able to rest easy knowing that you won't rest *too* easy when the morning comes around.",
