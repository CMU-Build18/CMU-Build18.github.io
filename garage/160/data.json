    "extended_details": "Ultrasonics have been growing in popularity in the automotive industry for use in driver assistance tools (i.e. blind-spot car detection, parallel parking assistance).  Ultrasonics have a reputation for being noisy and difficult, but we believe that automotive ultrasonics could be utilized for obstacle detection on buggies due to their low cost and high durability.",
