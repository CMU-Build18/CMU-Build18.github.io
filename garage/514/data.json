    "extended_details": "The space elevator is not happening. The idea of a superstructure stretching miles into the sky has always been impossible, hindered by the lack of a material strong enough to hold itself up.\r\n\r\nThe space fountain is a proposed 2-platform system that magnetically propels metal balls from a ground platform to a floating platform, which catches their kinetic energy and shoots them back down to the ground to generate lift. The benefit of the space fountain is that no super-strong structure is needed, meaning it can be done with existing technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, there has never been a proof-of-concept implementation of the space fountain. We would like to change that.",
