                            The goal of our project was to build a physical piano-like instrument that could play a song
                            inputted by a user. In order to play the piano, the user presses keys (on laptop) in order
                            to play notes on a virtual piano UI. The Scottychord then plays the song back with the same
                            melody and rhythm that was played. The instrument is built with lyre strings hit by small
                            wooden hammers. These hammers are glued to motors which spin and hit the strings to make
                            music. Each motor is connected to a relay, and each relay is connected to a single 9V
                            battery source. The relay trigger is connected to an Arduino MEGAâ€™s digital output pins. The
                            piano interface is built using pygame and serial. It sends the song to the Arduino MEGA as a
                            string. MEGA receives the string via USB and runs code that parses the string and plays the
                            song. We ended up changing much of our implementation. Previously, we designed and 3Dprinted
                            a mechanism to pluck the lyre strings, taking inspiration from guitar picking and a
                            harpsichord (the precursor to the modern piano). However, we found out that the mechanism
                            was too heavy and required too much precision for the motors. We pivoted to a wooden hammer
                            mechanism to directly hit the strings to produce sound. The relays ended up being used to
                            control which keys are played and when. The strings were strung across the top of the
                            instrument similar to a lyre. We used hot glue to hold the wood together and a small
                            breadboard to share the battery source. </p>
