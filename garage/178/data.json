    "extended_details": "Our project is to create a tabletop upright piano where the strings are replaced with lasers. The keys of the piano, instead of actuating a hammer to strike the strings, will move a blocker to block the laser. A microcontroller will read out the lasers that are currently blocked as the key being pressed and will mix and output the sound.",
