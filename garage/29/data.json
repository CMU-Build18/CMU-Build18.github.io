    "extended_details": "If you've never interacted with it, ferrofluid is quite cool. It's magnetic qualities make it capable of performing all sorts of acrobatics under the right fields. Thus, we aim to create a small device to manipulate the fluid for our visualizing pleasure. Our device will be built around a small jar of a ferrofluid and water mixture, and will leverage an array of electromagnets controlled by a single computer to create interesting patterns within the jar.",
