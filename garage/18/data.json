    "detail": "Villagers in Congo need electricity, which they can generate on their daily water run!",
    "extended_details": "This project will build a water-roller-powered battery charger for home lighting and cell phone charging.  Since women and children throughout Sub-Saharan Africa must walk an average of 6 km to get water, we will prototype a battery charger that they can power during this commute, spinning the shaft of a DC motor (acting as a generator) while they push water along the ground in a roller.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charged battery will then be able to UV purify the water inside the roller as well as light homes to let children study in the evening, support adults working at night, and charge cell phones for the whole family.",
