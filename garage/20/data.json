    "detail": "We are building a distributive computation farm out of Raspberry Pi Zeros.",
    "extended_details": "The Raspberry Pi Zero puts all of the power of an actual Raspberry Pi in  a $5 form factor. This makes it the cheapest computing unit you can purchase, while still living within most of the comfort of the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. Following the lead of the likes of Google and Amazon, our goal is to turn a set of cheap computers into an ostensibly powerful single computer, via the power of distributed computing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur target application is Merge Sort, Graphics Farm, BitCoin mine (we'll pick one). Ideally, we'll mask the entire system so that to the end user, it appears as though a single computer is being used. Either that, or some very thin set of functions that allow code to be easily distributed.\r\n\r\nImplementation plan:\r\n* Over winter break, create custom Arch Linux images to apply to all raspberry pi zero's.\r\n* Over winter break, explore communication protocols to identify best fit.\r\n* Obtain all parts\r\n* Construct housing for the raspberry pi zero's\r\n* Link together all device",
