    "extended_details": "We want to replicate /r/place tangibly. There will be a website similar to the actual /r/place where registered users can edit pixels every few minutes. However, rather than an online canvas, there will be a camera pointed toward a physical canvas. When users edit a pixel, the change will be carried out by a yet to be decided mechanism, but most likely a robot that drives to the correct location and paints that part of the canvas, or a paintball gun that fires at the desired location.",
