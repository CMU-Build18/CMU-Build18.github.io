    "extended_details": "Before starting to assemble the hardware, we had to plan out where to place the IMU units (that collect accelerometer and gyroscope data) to make meaningful gestures. In the end, we decided to place units on three separate fingers since moving the fingers would give us more varied data to work with. We also put the time of flight (ToF) sensor (that dictates when to brake and is activated by putting another hand above the glove) on the top of the glove hand. All of the wiring (including the microcontroller that processes the IMU data) is done on the top of the glove as well (which makes for easier connectivity). Next, we wrote the code that collects the IMU data. Since each IMU is identical, the I2C address is also identical, so in order to differentiate between each of the three sensors, we used a mux and wired a different IMU sensor to each channel of the mux, and then with the Arduino, we collected data from each mux channel separately. We did a similar process with the ToF sensor. These inputs are used to activate keyboard commands which are sent to the computer. The outcome was a working glove that could interface with “wasd” keys which allows us to play games. The game we decided to feature with this project is Forza Motorsport 8 which is historically known as a game that is not friendly to keyboard inputs. However, we hope this project can serve as a baseline into exploring other methods of control.",
