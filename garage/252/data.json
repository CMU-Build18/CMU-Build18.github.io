    "extended_details": "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a video game that involves multiple players. One player is actually playing the game, while the rest of the players are giving instructions. The goal of the to game is to defuse a bomb that has small puzzles that have to be solved. The twist is that the bomb defuser and the bomb instructor can see the other\u2019s point of view. The only form of communication that the players have is verbal. The small puzzles, called modules, on the bomb have instructions that prey on the difficulty of verbal confusion. For example, one module has buttons with symbols on them, and the defuser has to communicate which symbols are on the module to the bomb expert to figure out the right order to press them in. We want to make a physical game with tactile switches to bring the expertise of Keep Talking into the real world.\r\n\r\nLink to the design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/a/andrew.cmu.edu/document/d/1wTgRqjjdAQJ7HeRc0nDIVF7_MnZ5G_GI_Pl7XZxqWBM/edit?usp=sharing)",
