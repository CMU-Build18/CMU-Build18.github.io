    "extended_details": "For my digital design capstone (18-545), I worked a stereoscopic visual odometry coprocessor on a Xilinx FPGA (Zedboard). However, the Xilinx tools are very poorly documented and quite difficult to use. \r\n\r\nAltera has a similar FPGA to the Zedboard, so I wanted to see how much easier (or more difficult) the Altera tools are to use. The goal of the project will be to port the original project to the DE-1 SoC board (Cyclone V family).",
