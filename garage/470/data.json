    "extended_details": "Confused about your trash? Fear no more! We will build a transparent automatic trash and recyclables sorting bin.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to create a \"smart\" trash can that is able to sort trash into 3 different categories: general trash, recyclable, and compostable. Many recyclable materials end up in the wrong place because people do not have time or do not care to read the labels on trash cans, resulting in an efficient waste of material.\r\n\r\nThe most crucial part of the project is using machine learning to recognize different types of trash and place them in the correct categories. This was mainly facilitated by a Raspberry Pi, Python code, and the Google Cloud Vision API. The servo motors which orient the plates are controlled by GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nSee [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Os5E4Nk0GDNA7Dltmqk1sXCcyrqN40WZ?usp=sharing) for diagrams and meeting minutes prior to and during Build week.",
