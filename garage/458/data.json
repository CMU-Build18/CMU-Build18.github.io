    "extended_details": "Worried that a loved one may experience a heart attack while everyone else is sleeping? Fear not, for Heart Detective is here! Heart Detective is a device that detects when a sleeping person experiences a heart attack from a distance noninvasively. Heart Detective synthesizes input on environmental variables such as sound from a variety of IoT sensors. When unusual activity is detected, the device applies a machine learning model to infer if the combination of the unusual inputs suggests a heart attack occurred. Next, the device sounds an alarm to alert family members nearby and contacts the nearest medical personnel.",
