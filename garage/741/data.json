    "extended_details": "The purpose of this project is to build three juggling balls that scream in pain when you drop them. This is intended to improve the userâ€™s juggling ability by making them feel guilty when they drop the juggling balls. Parts were used carefully. We used an IMU in a microcontroller to detect the acceleration of the juggling ball. When the ball acceleration hit a certain threshold, we triggered the soundboard screaming. Physical parts were created using 3D printer and sewing, and electronic connections were soldered. We made four juggling balls and a demo breadboard.",
