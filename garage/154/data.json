    "extended_details": "Remember the grand old days of windows XP, when the only games you had to play were [Pinball](http://www.classicgame.com/Pinball), [Solitaire](https://www.google.com/search?q=solitaire&oq=solitaire&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i61j69i60j69i59.766j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), and [Minesweeper](http://minesweeperonline.com/)? We're big fans of the classics, but in the day of VR and AR, they're starting to feel a little dated. To fix that, we're planning on taking the game of Minesweeper into the future!\r\n\r\nTo add another dimension to the game, we're going to build a physical 9x9 grid of buttons which you can walk around on. You'll use a phone or tablet to view the mine count at each location, and it's your job to traverse the minefield, identifying all of the mines. Should you misstep, a simulated explosion will indicate that you've died, which is bad for your health and should generally be avoided.\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/VasuAgrawal/MinesweepAR",
