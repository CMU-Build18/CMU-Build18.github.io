    "extended_details": "A person stands in front of the robot. We run live face detection to determine when they open their mouth. Once their mouth is open, we pull depth data from a Kinect to determine it's exact position.\r\n\r\nTwo high-torque servos pan and tilt the marshmallow launcher in order to follow a perfectly parabolic path into the open mouth. A continuous stream of marshmallows is launched until the person closes their mouth or moves their head away.\r\n\r\nThe marshmallow launcher uses a spring-solenoid mechanism, or a regulated low-pressure compressed air source for power. Consecutive marshmallows are loaded from a vertical tube with a custom feeder mechanism to avoid jams.",
