    "extended_details": "Using peristaltic pumps, our project blends liquids with high fidelity. For applications like creating on-camera liquids, the appeared color of the liquid must be carefully controlled. Our project can very accurately measure the volume of specific molarity ink concentrations to create ideal colors.",
