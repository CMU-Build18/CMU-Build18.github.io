    "extended_details": "Carnegie Mellon Rocket Command is competing in the NASA Student Launch Initiative, in which 45 university teams design an build a rocket to fly one mile high while completing a technical challenge. Our rocket proposal is Project PLAID, for Precision Launch and Autonomous IDentification, and we will be competing in the Target Detection Challenge. Using an onboard camera and flight computer, our Target Detection System will autonomously activate at launch, scan the incoming video feed for the targets, and store images of detected targets to be recovered following landing.",
